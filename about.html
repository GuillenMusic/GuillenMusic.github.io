  <p>
    Brandon Guillen (b. 2002) is a multi-instrumentalist, arranger, and music educator. As a student 
    at the University of Missouri, he has performed on horn, accordion, and piano 
    in a wide range of styles including jazz, Latin, and contemporary music. After recently
    taking a piano tech course under Lucy Urlacher, Brandon is ready to tune pianos across Mid-Mo!
    
    Brandon is an active arranger, particularly for horn ensembles, and is passionate 
    about expanding repertoire options for students and performers. His musical interests 
    reflect both his classical training and his Mexican heritage, often 
    blending stylistic traditions in creative ways. In addition to performing, Brandon is 
    dedicated to music education with a focus on student-centered teaching,
    inclusive pedagogy, and meaningful musical experiences for all learners. 
    Through Guillen Music, he offers personalized music lessons, 
    professional piano tuning, and custom music arrangements.
